I’m Joanna Gronkowska, a PhD candidate and passionate linguist specializing in French culinary discourse in online press. My research explores how language shapes our perceptions of food, culture, and identity. I value working with others and exchanging ideas, which is one of the main reasons I chose to pursue a career in academia. I love working with people who are as curious and enthusiastic about language as I am, and I find inspiration in every interaction.</p> <p>If you’re interested in my work, feel free to explore this page or reach out to me at joanna.gronkowska@doctoral.uj.edu.pl. I’m always happy to connect!</p> </body></html>
